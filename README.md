# Hespori Timer

Live: [Click Here](https://www.henry-pan.com/hespori-timer/)

A simple timer app to track when the next growth tick occurs for Hespori in Old School RuneScape. This timer also tracks anima plants, hardwood, and redwood trees as they share the same growth tick as Hespori. Because of how growth ticks work in OSRS, these times are the same for everyone, except for a small unique offset per player.

The timer will display time according to user's timezone. The growth tick offset can be edited and saved to local storage.

## Usage

Users can edit the text box containing the offset for a more accurate timer.

## Future Features

I may extend the timer to cover all crops but currently the focus is on Hespori.
